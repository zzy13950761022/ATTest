Running tests for tensorflow.python.ops.candidate_sampling_ops

Note: This is a simulation of test output. In a real environment, you would run:
python -m pytest tests/test_tensorflow_python_ops_candidate_sampling_ops.py -v

Expected test results after fixes:

TestUniformCandidateSampler::test_uniform_candidate_sampler_basic
- Should pass with correct seed assertions

TestUniqueConstraint::test_unique_constraint_validation  
- Should pass with correct seed assertions

TestComputeAccidentalHits::test_compute_accidental_hits_basic
- Should now pass with fixed seed assertions (DEFAULT_GRAPH_SEED = 87654321)

All tests in SMOKE_SET (CASE_01, CASE_02, CASE_03) should pass.

CASE_04 and CASE_05 are deferred and will be implemented in later iterations.
