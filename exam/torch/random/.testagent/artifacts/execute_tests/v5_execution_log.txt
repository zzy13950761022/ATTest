exam/torch_group/random/tests/test_torch_random.py::TestTorchRandom::test_fork_rng_basic_context[None-True-basic]
  /opt/anaconda3/envs/testagent-experiment/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/random.py:99: UserWarning: CUDA reports that you have 2 available devices, and you have used fork_rng without explicitly specifying which devices are being used. For safety, we initialize *every* CUDA device by default, which can be quite slow if you have a lot of GPUs.  If you know that you are only making use of a few CUDA devices, set the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES or the 'devices' keyword argument of fork_rng with the set of devices you are actually using.  For example, if you are using CPU only, set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= or devices=[]; if you are using GPU 0 only, set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 or devices=[0].  To initialize all devices and suppress this warning, set the 'devices' keyword argument to `range(torch.cuda.device_count())`.
