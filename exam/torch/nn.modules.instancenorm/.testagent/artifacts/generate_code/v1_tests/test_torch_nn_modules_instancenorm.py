Main test file for torch.nn.modules.instancenorm.
Tests are organized into group files for better modularity.

# Import tests from group files
# This allows running all tests with: pytest tests/test_torch_nn_modules_instancenorm.py

# Note: Individual group files can be run separately:
# - pytest tests/test_torch_nn_modules_instancenorm_g1.py
# - pytest tests/test_torch_nn_modules_instancenorm_g2.py (when created)
